# SystemInspector

Welcome to the GitHub repository for SystemInspector! This project focuses on developing an application that captures basic system information, allowing users to monitor and analyze various aspects of their system. By utilizing technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chrome API, and Material UI, we have created an app that provides insights into the operating system, CPU, battery, memory, and system events.

Features
System Information Capture: SystemInspector captures and displays essential system information, including details about the operating system, CPU, battery, and memory. This provides users with a comprehensive overview of their system's specifications.

Diagnostics Routines and Testing: The application allows users to run diagnostics routines to test system performance and identify potential issues. These routines help users assess the health and performance of their system.

System Event Monitoring: SystemInspector enables users to monitor system events, such as Bluetooth device connections and USB cable insertions. This functionality helps users stay informed about the connectivity status and peripheral devices connected to their system.

Chrome Extension Integration: The application is integrated with a companion Chrome extension that retrieves and displays system information. This integration provides users with a seamless experience across their browser and the SystemInspector app.

Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: The frontend of the application is developed using these core web technologies. HTML provides the structure, CSS handles the styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to the application.

Chrome API: The Chrome API is utilized to access system information and retrieve data from the user's system. It enables SystemInspector to gather and display accurate system details.

Material UI: Material UI is employed to implement a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. It offers pre-built components and styling options that enhance the overall design and user experience of the application.
